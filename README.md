## üòä Introduction
***
### Hi everyone!

This section is responsible for the backend functionality. It handles essential tasks like user
registration, add accommodation, address, booking functionality, payment, admins notification by telegramBot.

The system is developed with the Spring Boot framework, adhering to the MVC architectural pattern. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database for backend support and manages the schema using Liquibase. All functionalities are exposed through a RESTful API, complemented by integrated Swagger documentation for a smooth user experience.

### How it Works:

- **Register:** To get access to all the features, start by creating an account.
- **Browse accommodations and booking it:** Explore our wide selection of accommodation, booking accommodation on needs 
  date, and pay or canceled a booking.
- **Personal Account:** Your booking and payments history are stored in your personal account, making it easy to keep track.
